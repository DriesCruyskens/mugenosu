about: "I'm a Brussels based programmer with a passion for generative art. I
  came in contact with Processing through my studies and quickly became
  interested in the concept of generating something visually attractive and
  unique each time a program is run.\r

  \r

  More recently, I discovered the vibrant community of pen plotters. It's a
  lot of fun to be able to draw your artwork using fountain pens, markers or
  even paint brushes using scalable vector graphics instead of having to rely on
  high resolution images and professional print shops. Because I often struggle
  with having too much options it's also very welcoming to being limited to
  drawing lines only.\r

  Currently I make most of my sketches using javascript as it is easier for me
  to develop, debug and share on the internet. Starting out using P5js, I
  eventually switched to Paperjs since I never quite got the SVG export function
  in P5js to work with Webpack. I only ever switch back to Processing when more
  performance is needed.\r

  This site is mainly used for posting more information on the process of
  making my sketches. Most of them are available to test out in the browser
  although it must be said they are pretty messy and I made few attempts to make
  them performant or easy to use so beware, they might freeze your browser. For
  fellow programmers the (also sloppy at times) source code for sketches and
  this website is also made publicly available on my Github."
